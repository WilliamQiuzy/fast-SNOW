None of the bears’ bodies shift toward the camera while still facing away; there is no consistent opposite-direction sliding that would indicate backward walking.  \n3) **Conclusion:** Since no bear shows motion opposite to the direction it is facing, **zero** bears are moving backwards from their own perspective.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A"

Over the sequence it mostly stays in roughly the same spot relative to the trail edge and the red object, appearing to nudge/turn rather than clearly advance forward leftward.\n\nThus, 3 bears are moving forward from their own perspective.

After that, the dog continues leftward and later completes **a second** clear hurdle jump to the left (another distinct airborne-over-bar moment with landing further left).\n3. The final visible jump in the later frames (around 24.3–24.5) is over a larger hurdle but it is **to the right**, not to the left, so it does **not** count toward the left-jump total.\n\nThat gives a total of **2** leftward jumps.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C"

In the early frames, the rider is centered and gets progressively larger in the frame, indicating the kart is approaching the camera. Later, the rider passes by and is seen from the side and then from behind as he continues away, consistent with continuous forward travel (first toward the camera, then past it). The kart’s orientation (the rider facing in the direction of travel with feet on the front footrest) matches this: as he approaches, his torso and feet face the camera, meaning the front of the kart is leading. From the go-kart’s own perspective, it is moving in the direction it is facing—i.e., forwards. Therefore, the final answer is: C"

When a ball rolls without slipping, its rotation direction is determined by the direction of travel: the bottom point of the ball must have zero velocity relative to the ground, so the ball must rotate so that the surface at the bottom moves opposite the direction of travel (to cancel the forward motion there).\n\nHere the ball moves leftward. For leftward rolling, the ball’s rotation (as viewed from the camera) is **counter-clockwise**: the top of the ball moves left while the bottom surface moves right relative to the ball, matching the no-slip condition.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D"

In the frames shown, there is one person clearly sliding down the left lane (closer to the camera), and another person sliding down the right lane (coming down from near the top). Since both are on the slide and moving downward simultaneously, the total number of people going down the water slide is two. Therefore, the final answer is: $C"

However:\n- The runner is only clearly visible for a short portion of the sequence.\n- The camera motion (cyclist speed) is not quantified, and the apparent motion of the runner in the frame is affected by perspective and the cyclist passing by.\n- There isn’t a reliable fixed reference or enough consistent overlap to conclude the runner is matching speed, slower, or faster than the cyclist.\n\nSo, the scene does not provide sufficient information to confidently compare their speeds.

In the early frames, the shuttlecock is near the players and below the net height.\n2. Mid-sequence, the shuttlecock is clearly seen rising high into the air, appearing near the ceiling lights and overhead beams.\n3. The camera perspective appears to be at about head height behind the nearer player (not near the ceiling). Since the shuttlecock rises to near the ceiling, it must have gone above the camera’s height.\n4.

Also, the perspective is wide-angle and the shuttle’s exact landing/receiving location is not shown clearly enough to determine whether it traveled diagonally into the opposite service box (cross court) or straight ahead into the parallel box (down the line). Because the key evidence—where the shuttle crosses the net and/or where it lands—is not unambiguously visible, the direction cannot be concluded from the scene.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C"

As the sequence continues, the camera pans leftward across the sink area and then further left toward the tall unit where the fridge is located. A leftward pan corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation (from an overhead perspective), indicating the person turned counter-clockwise to face the fridge. Therefore, the final answer is: C"

Tracking the chopsticks’ tip position over time, it moves from the right side of the pot toward the bottom, then toward the left side, and back upward—forming a circular motion. Moving right → down → left → up corresponds to a clockwise rotation when viewed from above. Therefore, the final answer is: D"
