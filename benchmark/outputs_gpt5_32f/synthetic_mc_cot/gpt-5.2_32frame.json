To determine “upward” vs “downward,” we track its vertical position relative to fixed background references (the window and the wall features). The drone stays at essentially the same height throughout the montage—there’s no consistent rise toward the ceiling or drop toward the floor—so it isn’t moving upward or downward.

Across the frames, the turtle’s position stays essentially fixed relative to the background and the camera; there is no clear translation to the left or to the right (no noticeable change in its location), so it does not appear to be moving in a direction.
