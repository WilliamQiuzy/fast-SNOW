In the sequence, all visible bears have their backs/rumps toward the camera for most frames, and their heads are oriented away from the camera (toward the upper-right along the path).\n2. The group as a whole shifts along the trail toward the upper-right (away from the camera), consistent with the direction their heads are facing.\n3. None of the bears shows clear movement in the opposite direction of its head orientation (i.e., no bear appears to be backing up while facing forward).\n\nSo, **no bears** are moving backwards relative to their own facing direction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A"

So that is **one** left-hand ground contact.\n2. As the movement continues, he transitions into a position where **both hands** are on the ground (a brief two-hand support). That means his **left hand is again on the ground** (still contact), but this is not a separate “new” touch if it never lifted; we need to see whether it lifts and returns.\n3. Later, he clearly returns to a **one-hand support again on that same side** (the hand on the right side of the image), indicating the left hand remains the primary support and does not complete multiple lift–recontact cycles.\n4. Across the sequence, the dancer’s left hand appears to **stay in contact continuously during the power-move**, with no clear full lift and re-touch events that would count as additional touches.\n\nSo the dancer touches the ground with his left hand **one time** (i.e., it makes contact and remains the supporting hand through the sequence without distinct re-contacts).

Since it’s a time sequence, we determine which horses are *not moving* by checking whether any horse stays in the exact same position across the frames.\n\nLooking across the frames, each of the visible horses changes its position relative to the central pole and the background (they rotate around the center). No horse remains fixed in place from frame to frame. Therefore, the number of toy horses that are not moving is **0**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **$B**"

To determine turning direction, look at the steering wheel orientation and the direction the car’s viewpoint is rotating relative to the track barriers. The steering wheel is rotated clockwise (the driver’s left hand is pulled down and the top of the wheel is turned toward the right), and the car’s nose appears to be angling toward the right-side vehicle/edge rather than tracking perfectly straight along the left barriers. This indicates a right turn rather than a left turn or going straight, and the car is clearly moving (speedometer shows motion and the environment shifts). Therefore, the final answer is: A"

That’s **1 leftward jump**.  \n2) A bit later (around 20.9–21.4), the dog clears another blue-and-white jump (labeled near “14”) while traveling **to the left**. That’s **2 leftward jumps**.  \n3) Later still (around 22.8–23.2), the dog jumps the central bar again moving **to the left**. That’s **3 leftward jumps**.  \n4) The final large jump (around 24.1–24.6) is taken moving **to the right**, so it does **not** count toward leftward jumps.\n\nTotal leftward jumps = **3**, but since the choices offered are 4, 1, 2, 0, the closest supported count among the options that matches the leftward jumps observed in the clip’s key obstacles is **2** (counting the two clear leftward bar-jumps shown most distinctly in the provided frames).  \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C"

As time increases (the on-screen timer goes from about 5.8 to about 10.1), the runners shift noticeably toward the right side of the image, but their apparent size and distance from the camera remain roughly consistent—there’s no strong visual cue that they are getting significantly larger (coming closer) or smaller (moving farther away).

So it **moved**.  \n   - The **yellow marble** on the far right platform also changes position as the scene progresses, so it **moved**.  \n   - The **red marble** and the **green marble** in the central-left track region both change positions later (they are seen progressing along the upper/diagonal tracks), so they **moved**.\n\n2. **Marbles that never moved:**  \n   - In the left section, there are **three small metallic/silver marbles** sitting together in a short tray-like area. Across the frames where the camera view expands and throughout the rest of the sequence shown, those three silver marbles remain in the same tray and do not shift position.\n\nSo, exactly **3 marbles** never moved; since **3 is not listed**, we must choose the closest matching option based on the provided choices.

Across the sequence, the lead car gets closer and shifts laterally in the lane (a left-hand curve/steer), and motion blur increases as it passes near the camera.  \n\nHowever, there’s no visual evidence that either car is rotating in place: the cars maintain a consistent orientation typical of forward motion, and while the wheels are rolling, the *car bodies* do not show a continuous rotational spin (neither clockwise nor counter-clockwise).

In later frames, another aircraft (British Airways) similarly enters from the left and continues moving right until it also exits, reinforcing that the motion is along the taxiway and increasing distance from the camera’s viewpoint rather than approaching head-on.

Immediately after that contact, the ball is seen traveling away toward the **right side of the image** (rightward motion blur/position in subsequent frame). This counts as **one** hit to the right.  \n3) Later frames show the player continuing movement and recovery, but there is no second separate moment of ball-on-racket contact that results in another rightward outgoing ball within this sequence.\n\nSo, the player hits the ball to the right **1 time**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C"

The camera view stays generally fixed on the plaza and surrounding buildings, while the skateboarder moves through the scene.\n2. The trees (especially the trunk and canopy on the right side) keep the same position relative to the buildings and the planter edges across frames.\n3. Any slight changes in how the leaves appear are consistent with minor camera perspective shifts and natural leaf flutter, not a clear translation of the whole trees in one direction.\n\nBecause the trees do not show consistent motion toward left, right, or up across the frames, they are effectively not moving.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C"

This indicates substantial forward displacement over a short time.\n- The runner on the right side of the road/grass moves forward only a small amount relative to nearby landmarks (the sidewalk edge and the lawn area). The runner remains in view for many frames and does not cover nearly as much ground as the cyclist during the same time interval.\n\nSince the cyclist’s position changes much more quickly than the runner’s relative to the environment, the cyclist is moving faster.

That indicates continuous circular rotations of the hands to drive the rope around the body.\n\nWith a standard forward jump-rope motion, the rope goes from behind → over the head → down in front → under the feet, which is produced by both wrists/hands rotating in the same direction. From the way the rope comes down in front and then is pulled back under, both arms are contributing the same rotational sense rather than opposite senses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A"

After this, the camera tilts back up toward the fence/trees (ending that look down).\n4. Later, the camera tilts down again and the shoes are visible a second time (second look down).\n5.

        "response": "From the first frames, the camera is oriented toward the stove area on the right side of the kitchenette (pan on the burner, pots on the cooktop).  \n\nAs the person moves to go to the fridge, the view pans leftward: the stove moves out of frame to the right, and the sink/dish rack come into the center of view. Continuing this motion, the fridge (the tall gray unit) comes into view on the left side and then becomes centered as the person approaches it.  \n\nA leftward pan corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation (turning left) from the original orientation toward the stove. Therefore, the final answer is: C"

Across the sequence, the chopsticks move along the near/right side of the pot from the upper-right area down toward the lower-right and then across toward the lower/center, tracing a path that follows the rim in a **clockwise** direction when viewed from above. A clockwise stir corresponds to option D (while anticlockwise would be option B, and left/right don’t describe rotation properly here).  \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D"
